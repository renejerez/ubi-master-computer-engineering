The second cycle of studies leading to the Masters degree in Computer Engineering intends to form future engineers with a solid knowledge and the appropriate skills for the current labor market, as well as providing them with a basis for the frequency of the third cycle of studies (PhD) in Computer Engineering
The modules/courses were thought of to articulate teaching, learning, and research, being encouraged the integration and contact of the students with research groups of the Department of Computer Engineering. The ultimate objective of this master course is thus to develop in the students the critical sense and skills in the problem solving, enabling them to perform the engineering acts in Computer Engineer according to the standards of the professional boards for engineers at international level, in Europe and worldwide
