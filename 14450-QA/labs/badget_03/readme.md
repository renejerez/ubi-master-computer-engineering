Testing and development framework for systems with a REST API.

– A system interface with endpoints we can interact with.

– At an endpoint, we can send HTTPS request to:

• GET information that you are interested in.

• DELETE the information stored.

• PUT information into what is stored (ex: create a new entry)

• POST information (ex: update an existing record)

• Create requests and test cases using Postman.
