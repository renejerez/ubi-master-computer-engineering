1. Your task for today’s practical class, is to adapt the “linear_regression.py” script to
perform logistic regression.
    • At first, implement only the “two-classes” version
    • Generalize your script, to handle multi-class problems.
Also, consider different feature normalization strategies:
    • Min-max
    • Z-score
Download the data from the “wine” Dataset, available at the course web page.
• In this set, the goal is to use chemical analysis to determine the origin of
different wines.
• There are 13 attributes, all numeric (either integer or real numbers):
    1) Alcohol
    2) Malic acid
    3) Ash
    4) Alcalinity of ash
    5) Magnesium
    6) Total phenols
    7) Flavanoids
    8) Nonflavanoid phenols
    9) Proanthocyanins
    10)Color intensity
    11)Hue
    12)OD280/OD315 of diluted wines
    13)Proline 

The dependent variable is provided in the first column.
