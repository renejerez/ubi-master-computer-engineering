1. Implement one Python script to generate, by brute-force, “N” hypotheses of linear regression models, and keep the   best one.
   
2. Implement one Python script to obtain the closed-form solution of a linear regression problem with a single independent variable.
   
3. Implement one Python script to obtain the gradient descent solution of a linear regression problem.
    a. Using a fixed number of iterations as stop criterium;
    b. Stopping the algorithm when no relevant improvements occur;

4. Implement a computationally more efficient version of linear regression: batch linear regression.

5. Design and implement an “adaptive learning rate” strategy, where the idea is to use larger steps at the beginning of the iterative process, and iteratively decrease them once the solution is close.

6. Compare the computational/accuracy performance of the fixed vs adaptive learning rate strategies.
